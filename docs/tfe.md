# Introducing TF-Encrypted

[TF-Encrypted](https://tf-encrypted.io/) developed by [Dropout Labs](https://dropoutlabs.com/) is an easy-to-use framework for Secure Multi-party Computation (MPC) machine learning in TensorFlow. We have developed several projects based on TFE (e.g. The solution winning the iDASH2019 competition), and are actively contributing the contents to TFE.
